# PythonBootcamp

Hey all,
whoever is reading this. This is my back-up.

I have been aspiring to become a developer, just keep being depressed and having a lot of problems.

there are 100 days in this bootcamp, dont be afraid to look into any of them.
Whoever u are, wherever u are. If you are in my shoes, never give up ^^.
